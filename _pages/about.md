Hello and welcome! I'm a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://geog.umd.edu/'>Department of Geographical Sciences</a> at the <a href='https://umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, 
working with <a href='https://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~xie/'>Dr. Yiqun Xie</a>, and a member of <a href='https://gel.umd.edu/'>Global Ecology Lab</a>. My research integrates remote sensing, in situ observations, and process-based models to enable robust, scalable Earth-system monitoring and forecasting and develops user-inspired AI methods for mining spatiotemporal data to address geospatial challenges. My work spans land–atmosphere interactions and surface energy and radiative fluxes, high-resolution cloud and radiance nowcasting, and modeling and forecasting of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics.

In my PhD, I'm working on projects combining satellite data, real-world measurements, and radiative transfer 
models (RTM), supervised by Dr. Dongdong Wang. I use machine learning to improve the estimation and forecasting accuracy of surface Downward 
Shortwave Radiation (DSR).  Now, I'm looking into machine learning that integrates physical laws to improve 
how we understand environmental changes. 

Before I joined UMD, I graduated with a B.E. from <a href='https://en.whu.edu.cn/'>Wuhan University</a>, China, and a B.S. from the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a>, Canada.
