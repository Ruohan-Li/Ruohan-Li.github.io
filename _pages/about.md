Hello and welcome! I'm a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://geog.umd.edu/'>Department of Geographical Sciences</a> at the <a href='https://umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, 
working with <a href='https://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~xie/'>Dr. Yiqun Xie</a>, and a member of <a href='https://gel.umd.edu/'>Global Ecology Lab</a>. 

My research uses AI to integrate <strong>remote sensing, in situ observations, and process-based models</strong> to enable robust, high-resolution, and scalable <strong>Earth-system monitoring and forecasting</strong> and develops <strong>user-inspired AI methods</strong> for mining spatiotemporal data to address geospatial challenges. My work spans land–atmosphere interactions and surface energy and radiative fluxes, high-resolution cloud and radiance nowcasting, and modeling and forecasting of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics.

During my PhD, I contributed to several NASA satellite products, including <a href='https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/lpcloud-mcd18a1-062'>MODIS/Terra+Aqua MCD18</a>, VIIRS VNP18A1, and <a href='https://data.nas.nasa.gov/geonex/geonexdata/GOES16/GEONEX-L2/DSR-PAR/'>AHI/ABI GeoNEX DSR/PAR</a>, supervised by Dr. Dongdong Wang. In parellel, I use machine learning to address the accuracy–efficiency trade-off that limits physics-based retrievals at higher spatial resolution.

Before I joined UMD, I graduated with a B.E. from <a href='https://en.whu.edu.cn/'>Wuhan University</a>, China, and a B.S. from the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a>, Canada.
