Hello and welcome! I'm a postdoctoral research associate in the <a href='https://geog.umd.edu/'>Department of Geographical Sciences</a> at the <a href='https://umd.edu/'>University of Maryland, College Park</a>, 
working with <a href='https://www.terpconnect.umd.edu/~xie/'>Dr. Yiqun Xie</a> and <a href='https://geog.umd.edu/facultyprofile/loboda/tatiana-v'>Dr. Tatiana Loboda</a>. My research focuses extensively on leveraging deep learning and advanced 
analytical methods to interpret Earth system dynamics. 

In my PhD, I'm working on projects combining satellite data, real-world measurements, and radiative transfer 
models (RTM). I use machine learning to improve the estimation and forecasting accuracy of surface Downward 
Shortwave Radiation (DSR).  Now, I'm looking into machine learning that integrates physical laws to improve 
how we understand environmental changes. 

Before I joined UMD, I graduated with a B.E. from <a href='https://en.whu.edu.cn/'>Wuhan University</a>, China, and a B.S. from the <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'>University of Waterloo</a>, Canada.
